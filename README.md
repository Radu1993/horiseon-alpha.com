## Description 
01- Modules Challenge
I have rebuilt the site in order to make it easier to use.
My motivation is to work remote so I can travel the world and make money in the same time.
I built this project in order to improve myself and to gain more experience.
It's faster to run through web and code is cleaner.
I learned to not be repetitive with code lines and to make it simple and easier to understand for those who read it.
On the website I built , there are articles that speak about :
Search Engine Optimization;
Online Reputation Management;
Social Media Marketing;

## Intsallation
The website can be viewed at :
https://radu1993.github.io/horiseon-alpha.com/
 
 IT'S  DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY INSTALLATION TO RUN!

 ## Usage 
 The website can be browse  by clicking the right link into navigation bar.
